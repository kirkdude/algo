# Quantum-Safe Architecture for Algo VPN

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural decisions and implementation approach for integrating post-quantum cryptography into Algo VPN, creating a quantum-resistant VPN solution.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Post-Quantum Cryptography Library Selection

**Decision**: Use liboqs (Open Quantum Safe) as the primary post-quantum cryptography library.

**Rationale**:

- NIST-standardized algorithms (ML-KEM, ML-DSA)
- Active development and community support
- Integration with strongSwan and other VPN solutions
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Comprehensive algorithm support

**Trade-offs**:

- ✅ Standardized, well-tested algorithms
- ✅ Broad ecosystem support
- ❌ Still in development/research phase
- ❌ Performance overhead vs classical crypto

### 2. VPN Protocol Strategy

**Decision**: Implement hybrid classical + post-quantum approach with strongSwan IPsec as primary target.

**Phase Implementation**:

- **Phase 1**: Development environment and liboqs integration
- **Phase 2**: strongSwan post-quantum integration
- **Phase 3**: WireGuard post-quantum enhancement
- **Phase 4**: Integration and performance testing
- **Phase 5**: Production deployment

**Rationale**:

- Hybrid approach provides backward compatibility
- strongSwan has mature post-quantum support
- Phased approach reduces implementation risk
- Allows gradual migration from classical crypto

### 3. Algorithm Selection

**Primary Algorithms**:

- **Key Encapsulation**: ML-KEM-768 (192-bit security level)
- **Digital Signatures**: ML-DSA-65 (192-bit security level)

**Security Level Rationale**:

- 192-bit provides strong security without excessive overhead
- Balances performance with future-proofing
- Recommended by NIST for most use cases

**Algorithm Support Matrix**:

```yaml
ML-KEM (Key Encapsulation):
  - ML-KEM-512  # 128-bit security (lightweight)
  - ML-KEM-768  # 192-bit security (recommended)
  - ML-KEM-1024 # 256-bit security (high security)

ML-DSA (Digital Signatures):
  - ML-DSA-44   # 128-bit security (lightweight)
  - ML-DSA-65   # 192-bit security (recommended)
  - ML-DSA-87   # 256-bit security (high security)
```

### 4. Integration Architecture

**Ansible-Based Deployment**:

- New `quantum-safe` role for post-quantum library management
- Integration with existing `strongswan` role
- Automated testing and validation infrastructure
- Configuration management for hybrid setups

**Directory Structure**:

```
/opt/quantum-safe/
├── liboqs-config.yaml      # Main configuration
├── logs/                   # Monitoring and test logs
├── tests/                  # Validation scripts
├── configs/                # Generated configurations
├── monitoring/             # Performance monitoring
└── benchmarks/             # Performance data
```

### 5. Performance Considerations

**Expected Performance Impact**:

- Key generation: ~2-5x slower than classical
- Handshake overhead: ~70x data increase (acceptable for VPN)
- Computational overhead: ~2.3x CPU usage
- Memory usage: Minimal impact

**Optimization Strategy**:

- Use optimized implementations (AVX2, NEON where available)
- Cache quantum-safe keys when possible
- Monitor performance metrics continuously
- Provide classical fallback options

### 6. Security Architecture

**Hybrid Security Model**:

```
Classical Security + Post-Quantum Security = Total Security
```

**Implementation Approach**:

- Classical algorithms provide immediate security
- Post-quantum algorithms provide future quantum resistance
- Combined approach protects against both classical and quantum attacks

**Key Management**:

- Separate classical and post-quantum key hierarchies
- Secure key derivation functions
- Key rotation policies for both algorithm types
- Backup and recovery procedures

### 7. Compatibility and Migration

**Client Compatibility**:

- Maintain compatibility with existing IPsec clients
- Graceful degradation to classical crypto when needed
- Progressive enhancement for quantum-safe capable clients

**Migration Strategy**:

1. **Phase 1**: Development environment setup
2. **Phase 2**: Server-side quantum-safe capability
3. **Phase 3**: Client configuration updates
4. **Phase 4**: Full quantum-safe deployment
5. **Phase 5**: Classical crypto deprecation (future)

### 8. Testing and Validation

**Multi-Level Testing Approach**:

**Unit Tests**:

- Algorithm functionality validation
- Key generation and exchange tests
- Performance benchmarking

**Integration Tests**:

- strongSwan quantum-safe handshakes
- End-to-end VPN connectivity
- Hybrid classical+PQ scenarios

**System Tests**:

- Multi-client scenarios
- Network failure recovery
- Performance under load

**Security Tests**:

- Cryptographic validation
- Implementation security review
- Penetration testing

### 9. Monitoring and Observability

**Key Metrics**:

- Algorithm usage statistics
- Performance metrics (latency, throughput)
- Error rates and fallback frequency
- Security event logging

**Monitoring Tools**:

- Custom performance monitoring scripts
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Real-time alerting for security events
- Periodic security validation

### 10. Risk Management

**Identified Risks and Mitigations**:

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Algorithm standardization changes | High | Medium | Version pinning, update procedures |
| Performance degradation | Medium | High | Benchmarking, optimization, fallback |
| Implementation vulnerabilities | High | Low | Security review, testing |
| Client compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Hybrid approach, graceful degradation |
| Deployment complexity | Low | High | Ansible automation, documentation |

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Workflow

1. **Environment Setup**: Use `quantum-safe-dev.yml` playbook
2. **Algorithm Testing**: Run comprehensive test suite
3. **Performance Validation**: Execute benchmarking scripts
4. **Integration Testing**: Validate with strongSwan
5. **Security Review**: Cryptographic implementation audit

### Configuration Management

**Development Configuration**:

```yaml
quantum_safe_dev_mode: true
quantum_safe_testing: true
quantum_safe_benchmarks: true
```

**Production Configuration**:

```yaml
quantum_safe_dev_mode: false
quantum_safe_testing: true
quantum_safe_benchmarks: false
create_hybrid_configs: true
backup_classical_configs: true
```

### Best Practices

1. **Always use hybrid configurations** in production
2. **Test thoroughly** before deployment
3. **Monitor performance** continuously
4. **Keep classical backup** configurations
5. **Stay updated** with algorithm developments
6. **Document all** configuration changes
7. **Train operators** on quantum-safe concepts
